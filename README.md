## About Us

**Fifth Segment Engineering** builds pragmatic tools for controls engineers, system integrators, and industrial developers.

In the ISA-95 automation model, the "Fifth Level" is where the corporate network meets the factory floor. This is where connectivity happens, but it's also where friction occurs—especially regarding security, certificates, and cross-vendor compatibility.

We exist to eliminate that friction. We take complex IT security concepts (like PKI and x.509 certificates) and wrap them in usable, robust tooling designed specifically for the constraints of industrial environments.

## Our Philosophy

We believe industrial tools should be:

1.  **OT-First:** Built with an understanding of air-gapped networks, legacy hardware, and the imperative of uptime.
2.  **Vendor-Neutral:** Your plant has mixed hardware. Our tools play nice with everyone.
3.  **Transparent:** As an engineering-focused organization, we prioritize clear documentation and predictable software behavior.
